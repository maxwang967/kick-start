# Kick Start Repository

## What is this for?

To record code implementations for algorithms.

## Will this repo be updated frequently?

Not quite sure. This repo will only be updated when I find some interesting solutions for specific algorithms or under the regulation of the so-called "current plan".

## What is the current plan?

- [ X ] Daily Challenge EVERYDAY.
